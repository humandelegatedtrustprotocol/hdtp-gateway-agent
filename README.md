# hdtp-gateway-agent

An open-source [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) agent that answers an
[hdtp-gateway](https://github.com/humandelegatedtrustprotocol/hdtp-gateway) node's contacts on
behalf of its owner, in the voice `persona.md` sets. It is woken by the node's webhook and acts
through the node's owner MCP; the model drafts the text and has no tools.

The model is OpenAI's GPT-6 Luna through
[OpenRouter](https://mastra.ai/models/gateways/openrouter) by default
(`openrouter/openai/gpt-6-luna`, with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). `HDTP_AGENT_MODEL` takes any other
Mastra model router string instead, with that provider's key.

Work in progress: the full README follows once it has been run against a real node.

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # then fill it in
npm ci
npm run dev            # Mastra Studio at http://localhost:4111 (this machine only)
make check             # typecheck, tests, build
```

Apache-2.0.
